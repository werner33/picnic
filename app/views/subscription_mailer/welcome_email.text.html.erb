Welcome to ThePicnic.nyc!
===============================================
 
My name is Jordan and I host a picnic just about every Sunday evening
through the summer in Central Park and everyone is welcome!
<% if @picnic %>

The next picnic is in <%= distance_of_time_in_words_to_now(@picnic.date) %> on 
<%= @picnic.date.strftime("%A, %B %d at %l:%M %p") %>. 
Bring some food and your friends!     
 
To login to the site and RSVP, just follow this link: <%= @url %>.
    
<% else %>
There are currently no upcoming picnics. But don't worry, we'll email
you as soon as the next one is planned. In the mean time, you can think
about what you're going to bring. ;)

<% end %>
 
Look forward to seeing you!

Jordan.
