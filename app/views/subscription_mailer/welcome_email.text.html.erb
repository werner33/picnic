Welcome to ThePicnic.nyc!
===============================================
 
My name is Jordan and I host a picnic just about every Sunday evening
through the summer in Central Park and everyone is welcome!

The next picnic is in <%= distance_of_time_in_words_to_now(@picnic.date) %> on 
<%= @picnic.date.strftime("%A, %B %d at %l:%M %p") %>. 
Bring some food and your friends!
